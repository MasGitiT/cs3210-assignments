# Course Project

## Introduction

The goal of the course project is to solidify the foundational C++ knowledge obtained in this course by desinging and implementing a functional, larger-scope software system. The project topic has been chosen to necessitate the use of a wide array of language concepts and features we studied/will study, including separate compilation, user-defined types, inheritance, run-time polymorphism, resource management, smart pointers, containers and algorithms, file input/output, and other standard library facilities. We haven't covered some of these topics in details yet, but, generally speaking, you should be able to start working of the project right away. 

Note that the project definition includes a couple of "stretch goals". Those are optional enhancements on top of the core project that you might choose to explore to obtain extra credits (or perhaps simply because they seem fun).


## Grading / progress tracking

**The project due date is midnight, Wednesday, May 1st.** Late project submissions will be subject to a penalty of a 25% reduction in points for every 24-hour period they are late.

As per the syllabus, **the project constitues 30% of your total grade**. The project's grade itself will be a function of the following criteria:

| Project Evaluation Criteria | Grade percentage | Explanation | 
| ----------------------------- | --------------------- | -------------- |
| Functional requirements | 50% | Does the delivered software satisfy the project's stated functional requirements? |
| Quality of the final executable | 15% | Absence of errors during the normal execution, as well as graceful handling of error conditions. | 
| Quality of the design and implementation | 15% | Is the project implemented using idiomatic, well-structured C++? |
| Test coverage | 10% | Usage of unit/functional testing to assist project development. |
| Weekly project updates | 10% | See below. |

### Weekly project updates

To help facilitate a healthy development pace, you are required to submit (on Slack) **weekly project updates which answer the following questions**:

 - What have you done on the project so far?
 - What are you currently working on?
 - Are there any unsolved issues/errors youâ€™re currently trying to debug?

**The weekly updates are due at midnight every Wednesday, starting from Wednesday, March 3rd, up to and including Wednesday, April 24th**.

If you have any questions or concerns, please reach out as soon as you develop them. Regular demos/office hours visits to discuss your progress are essential for avoiding surprises with your final project grade.

### Progress tracking through Github

Due to the long-running nature of this project, **we'll be using Github to host the project's code and track your development progress**. If you don't have a Github account, please create one using your @uiowa.edu email address. If you have an existing Github account you'd like to use, please make sure your @uiowa.edu email is listed as your [public email](https://github.com/settings/profile). 

Once you are logged in to Github, follow [these instructions](https://help.github.com/en/articles/create-a-repo) to **create a private repository for your project**, then invite **@agurtovoy** and **@srinvsn** as [collaborators](https://help.github.com/en/articles/inviting-collaborators-to-a-personal-repository). 

When reporting progress in your weekly updates, please **make sure to push the corresponding code to your Github repo**. Failure to do so consistently will affect the "Weekly project updates" portion of your project grade.

Use of Github issues and wiki functionality to track & document your project state is welcome and encoraged.
