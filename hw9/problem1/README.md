# HW9 â€” Problem 1

## Problem statement

Bob got tasked with designing a simple `PhoneBook` class to efficiently store and lookup people and their phone numbers. With some help from Alice he came up with what he thought was a nice interface and the corresponding set of test cases. Alice was pretty busy with her own project, though, and couldn't help with the actual implementation, so Bob turned to you.

Implement the  `PhoneBook` class that is efficient and passes all Bob's tests. Do not modify  `main.cpp` .
